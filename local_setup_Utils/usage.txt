1 - clone the referee source (game source code)

*the local referee is setup to be compiled as a library.
*we need to make it complie as an executable by add adding the main function.
* and we need to give this main the ability to get input from command line.
     ( when we execute this program we should be able to pass the playes and other other information as argument
        and the main shuld parce them before running the reffere)

to do this we need to:

2 - update the pom.xml file (pom.xml == config in maven)
    add the configrations from pom_extra.xml as stated by the comments

3 - add the main function in the project (CommandLineInterface.java file)
in the same pth as stated in pom.xml (the code u added on step to be exact) + './src/main/java/' at begining
exmple: 
    <mainClass>com.codingame.gameengine.runner.CommandLineInterface</mainClass>
    path weill be :
    ./src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/runner/CommandLineInterface.java

4- add the Renderer.java file at ./src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/runner/Renderer.java;
    (this will create the image graphics for the game)


5- at the file /SummerChallenge2024Olymbits/src/main/resources/package.json
(replace SummerChallenge2024Olymbits with the repo name)
add "build" : tsc  to scripts
like this :
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "tsc -w",
    "build": "tsc" << add this (with the ',' ofc)
  },

now the referee should compile as a executabe.
to compile we need:
    install Java 17 / sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
    install maven   / sudo apt install maven
    install npm    / sudo apt install nodejs npm
     note (u can use docker or a VM if u dont have acces to sudo)

and than we staret compiling with (from root of the cg repo):
    * cd src/main/resources
    * npm install (dont use audit fix leave the vunrabity as they are)
    * npm run build

than at the root of the repo (where pom.xml is) we run;
    *mvn package

the executable will be created at
./target
with the name 
spring-2024-olympics-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
as stated in pom.xml file in 
    <artifactId>spring-2024-olympics</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

and to execut we run ;
    java -jar spring-2024-olympics-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
